Setting Up the Development Environment

Eclipse IDE:  Download and install the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers from the official Eclipse website: https://eclipse.org/downloads. This provides a comprehensive development environment for Java applications.

MySQL Connector/Java: Download the mysql-connector-java-8.0.29.jar file (or a compatible version) from the official MySQL downloads page: https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/. This library enables Java programs to connect and interact with MySQL databases.

MySQL Workbench: Download and install MySQL Workbench from the official MySQL downloads page: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/. This graphical tool simplifies database administration tasks such as schema design, query execution, and data management.

Project Structure and Class Definitions

Create a Project: Within Eclipse, create a new Java project. Give it a meaningful name, such as "BusBookingSystem." This project will house your Java source files and class definitions.

Package Structure (Optional): While not strictly mandatory for small projects, consider creating packages within your project to organize your code better. For example, a package named "com.example.busbooking" could hold your application-specific classes.

Main File (BusDemo.java):
this takes the initiation of the whole process

Booking Class (Booking.java):
The Booking class encapsulates passenger information, chosen bus details, and booking operations. It includes methods like:

checkSeatAvailability: To query the database using the BusDAO and verify seat availability.
isDateValid: To ensure the travel date is in the future (consider using a date/time handling library like java.time).


BusDAO (BusDataAccessObject.java):
The BusDAO (Bus Data Access Object) interface defines methods for interacting with the database regarding bus information. Here, it exposes a checkSeats method to check availability for a specific bus, date, and number of seats. Depending on your application's needs, additional methods could be added to retrieve bus details or manage bus data.

BookingDAO (BookingDataAccessObject.java):
If your application requires persistent storage of booking information, create a BookingDAO interface. It could include a saveBooking method to persist booking data to the database and other methods for booking management (e.g., cancellation, retrieval).

Connecting to the Database:

Within your DAO classes (like BusDAO and potentially BookingDAO), implement the logic to connect to the MySQL database using the downloaded mysql-connector-java library and execute database queries to retrieve or store data.
